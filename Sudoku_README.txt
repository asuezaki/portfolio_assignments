Instructions for sudoku.py HW 8 Portfolio Project
1. Make sure you are familiar with the rules of Sudoku. All cells are to be filled such that each row and each column
   is distinctly numbered from 1-9 with no duplicates and no specific order. Cells to be filled are marked with a 0.
2. Run Sudoku.py. The program will display the board and prompt the user for input via the terminal. Rows and columns
   are numbered from 1-9 from left to right and top to bottom respectively.

Note: The game will automatically call the verification algorithm once all empty spaces in the board have been filled.
It will then notify the user if they are correct or not and then ask if they want to play again which will reset the
board to the starting state if selected.
An easy puzzle with fewer steps was implemented to make testing and grading easier.
