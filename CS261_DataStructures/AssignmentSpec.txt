This hash map uses a hash table of buckets, each containing a linked list of hash links. 
Each hash link stores the key-value pair (string and integer in this case) and a pointer to the next link in the list.

Word_count.py takes an input document, computes the number of times each word was used in the document, and returns the top X words and associated counts.
